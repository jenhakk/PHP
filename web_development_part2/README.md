This was the second exercise where we utilized same site we did in [webvelopment_group3](https://github.com/jenhakk/webdevelopment_group3) project. Third part was to recreate the first site in Wordpress. That site isn't unfortunately available. 

The task was to program an element that utilizes database in the website. We kind of overdid this an ended up doing five different elements.

My part was to create registration and login for the user and admin. It is executed using forms, AJAX, JSON, JQuery and SQL.

**Elements were:**

- Registration and logging in (logging in as admin as well)

- Admin site where user can check, edit and delete data from database (done with htaccess)

- Feedback page

- Table reservation for registered users

- Take away system where customer can order take away

Project ended up expanding quite lot but we were happy about the result. We learned a lot and had good expression about backend programming. Unfortunately GitHub pages only support static websites so the site isn't usable here (except for the html files).

[Here is the front page of the site](https://jenhakk.github.io/PHP/web_development_part2/index.html)

**My files are:**

- registration.html

- register.php

- userlogged.php

- login.html

- checklogin.php

- edit.php

- logout.php

- admin.html

- users.php

- select.php

- editadmin.php
