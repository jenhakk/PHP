# Web development project part 2

This was the second exercise where we utilized same site we did in [webvelopment_group3](https://github.com/jenhakk/webdevelopment_group3) project. The task was to program an element that utilizes database in the website. We kind of overdid this an ended up doing five different elements.

**Elements were:**

- Registration and logging in (logging in as admin as well)

- Admin site where user can check, edit and delete data from database (done with htaccess)

- Feedback page

- Table reservation for registered users

- Take away system where customer can order take away

Project ended up expanding quite lot but we were happy about the result. We learned a lot and had good expression about backend programming. Unfortunately GitHub pages only support static websites so the site isn't usable here (except for the html files).

[Here is the front page of the site](http://shell.hamk.fi/~jenna20100/Projekti/web-development/index.html)

**My files are:**

- registration.html

- register.php

- userlogged.php

- login.html

- checklogin.php

- edit.php

- logout.php

- admin.html

- users.php

- select.php

- editadmin.php
